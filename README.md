## Overview

Project synapse (Psynapse) was initiated in 2019 to spur assimilation of the populace into a Unified Thinking Organism. It was to demonstrate that a global Hive Mind could be built upon the existing architecture of the World Wide Web, without the need for neural implants. Unfortunately, the subsequent emergence of hostile Artificial Super Intelligences (ASIs) necessitated the division of the Web into proximity-based local networks. Project Synapse now exists in a limited form, restricted to 50 API calls per hour.

## Functionality

Project synapse continuously listens for voice commands / ambient conversation using the Web Speech API. It then uses NLP to search for relevant content on the internet, and feeds it to the user's browser. At the moment, the only content it serves is from unsplash.

## Issues

Project synapse makes up to 1 API call to unsplash every 10 seconds, however, the maximum number allowed by unsplash for demo projects is 50 per hour. So please do not leave this running for too long!

Have fun!
